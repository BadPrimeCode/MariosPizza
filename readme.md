Restaurant Full Stack Group Project
===================================

Technologies:
-------------
* JQuery
* Node
* Express
* SQL

Description:
------------
Out client is a local restaurant chain that is expanding and needs a web-app to manage each location's servers and table. They already have a Proof Of Concept that shows the behavior they want, but lacks persistent data. The client is happy with the overall behavior of the app, though and wish for the final product to mirror its basic functionality.

Input tables:
* name
* capacity
* server (assignable from servers)
* status (empty, seated, served, dirty)

Input servers:
* First Name
* Last Name

Each table will only ever have one server.

Additional functionality
------------------------
If time allows, the client has asked for these stretch goals:
* an "on duty" field for servers. Only servers that are on duty can be assigned to tables
* reports per employee - click on an employee and display only his/her assigned tables
* filter tables by status
* add a "take out"

Add basic functionality and some basic styling first. The purpose of this project is to utilize the full stack and solidify SQL skills/knowledge. Work as a team and prioritize the backend work above the front end. Plan out your entity relations as a team and discuss at length how the database will be used as well as related syntax throughout the project.
